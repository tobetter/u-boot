== Installation ==

The raspberry pi targets can be installed by copying u-boot.bin to the
FAT partition of the raspberry pi boot firmware:

  mkdir -p /boot/fat
  mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /boot/fat
  cp -vb /usr/lib/u-boot/TARGET/u-boot.bin /boot/fat/

Then specify the u-boot.bin as the kernel to load in config.txt on the
FAT partition:

  kernel u-boot.bin

It should then support booting off of MMC and USB devices with serial
console or HDMI with USB keyboard.
